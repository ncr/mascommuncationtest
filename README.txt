MAS Communication Test
======================


To run the test, type:

java -cp target/mastest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.mastest.App

After 60 seconds it will print the number of sent/received messages.
Try this on Windows and some Linux on the same hardware and observe the huge difference in performance.
